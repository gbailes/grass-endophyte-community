Graham paper 

questions comments:

where is the otu table

site spatial data?
environmental data?
where is that OTU table...
where are the graphics of the MEM's?

todo:

Klamath Mountain, Willamette Valley, Puget Sound indicator species

point pattern was bad idea, so scratch that, or not....Graham is going to look into it.

find out what's weird about french flat
  - look for "famous" endophytes (i.e Rusty Rodriguez papers)
  - look for species unique to French flats 

Blast species stories at the conclusion, make sure they are what they think they are. 

run trend analysis, since it's almost a straight n/s trend and one of the MEM's was north south if I recall

For anybody
indicator species analysis - can we lump into ecoregions or ecotypes, and run indicator analyses 

Plan going forward:

- Graham is going to refine the ecological analysis pipeline, 
- This document will become what both Dan and Graham work on
- practice git, i.e pulling and pushing when working closely on same repo
- Graham and Dan will try collaboratively on the French Flat questions 
- Dan will accept graham's invite on zoom contacts
